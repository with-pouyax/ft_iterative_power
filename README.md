# ft_iterative_power

This repository presents the `ft_iterative_power` function, an iterative implementation designed to calculate the power of a number. The function raises a base number `nb` to the power of `power`, using a loop to perform the multiplication. This method offers a straightforward approach to understanding and implementing mathematical exponentiation in code.

## Function Overview

Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as `b^n`, involving two numbers, the base `b` and the exponent `n`. In the case of `ft_iterative_power`, `nb` acts as the base and `power` as the exponent, with the function calculating `nb` raised to the power of `power`.

### Function Prototype

```c
int ft_iterative_power(int nb, int power);
